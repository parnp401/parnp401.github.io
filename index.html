    <font face="Verdana" style="color:white;background-color:black;" size="2"> Our mission is to show the endless cycle of things, especially trash. We also want people to not only benefit from our concept, but also create somethings themselves.</font><br />
    <font face="Verdana" style="color:white;background-color:black;" size="2">The prototype I is made out of cardboard and trash. It looks playful and colorful.</font><br />
