  <font face="Verdana" size="4">//PLACE</font><br />
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">Cherry Hills is part of New York's famous Central Park and is located on the Upper Western part of the park.</font><br />
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">The place is known for its romantic water fountain and for the great photo spots towards the castle.</font><br />
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">It had always been a historic location for horse carriages too, because the fountain offers an accessible source of water for horses.</font><br />

  <font face="Verdana" size="2">As Cherry Hills is a circle, we were interested in the behaviour of visitors, horses, birds and dogs around.</font><br />
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">Our target groups are tourists and native New Yorkers.</font><br />
