  <font face="Verdana" size="4">//PLACE</font><br />
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">Cherry Hills is part of New York's famous Central Park and is located on the Upper Western part of the park.</font><br />
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">The place is known for its romantic water fountain and for the great photo spots towards the castle.</font><br />
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">It had always been an important location for horse carriages too, because the fountain offers an accessible source of water for the horses.</font><br />
